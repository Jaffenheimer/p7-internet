- First download docker if you dont have
- Then in a terminal navigate to the db-docker folder
- Then type ```docker compose up```
- Then in you favorite DB admin tool (I recommend DataGrip) open the db
- Then run the dbup project in the solution
- Update the db in the admin tool, and you should see the test table
